## Yotam Avraham  - FE Home assignment

In this exercise , I focused mainly on the functional part and didn't pay much  attention to the esthetics .
I used material-ui and create-react-app to expedite the development 

### what I did :
- Created global error boundary using Context and Composition   
- Created the comments component using the Presentational and Container Components  design pattern 
- Created a custom hook to encapsulate the using the pagination logic of the "/comments" EP


### what I didn't do  :
- The addComment flow was written in a quick and dirty approach 
- Unit tests
- Accessibility  adjustment 
- Device size and browser compatability (other than the built-in material-ui )   
- Create a Storybook
- Suppress console warnings
- Utilized types (typescript)

Thanks ,
Yotam
